# My Personal Project: Fitness Manager

## Manage Workouts, Track Progress, Stay Fit

- **What will the application do?**

> ***Fitness Manager*** is an application that helps users plan and track their workouts. Users can save exercises, log the weights they use, and monitor their progress over time. Features like workout logs, and progress tracking empower users to stay motivated and push toward their fitness goals.

- **Who will use it?**

> ***Fitness Manager*** is for users who want to track their workout progress, systematically increase weights over time, view all the workouts they saved and plan daily workout routines.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

> In the gym, I observed people taking notes after every set, recording how much weight they lifted to ensure they gradually increased their load. This inspired me to create an application that would simplify this process, making it easier for users to track their workouts and progress.
